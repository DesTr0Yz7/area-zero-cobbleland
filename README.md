## Cobbleland is a modded Minecraft server, where players can catch and train Pokemon using the Cobblemon mod for Minecraft.

## These packs are for a new update coming to the Cobbleland server, where a new warp will be added along with new and returning Pokemon.

## Datapacks should be added to Minecraft worlds specifically, under the datapack options when creating or editing a world.

## Resource packs should be added to the resource packs folder in the Minecraft instance, along with other resource packs.
